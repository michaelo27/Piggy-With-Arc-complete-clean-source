 * Single page app. The four UI states from the spec:
 *
 *   STATE 1  not connected                -> <Landing />
 *   STATE 2  connected, no active jar     -> <CreateJarForm />
 *   STATE 3  connected, jar locked        -> jar + countdown + break flow
 *   STATE 4  connected, jar matured       -> incentives + withdraw
 *   STATE 5  connected, target reached     -> principal now or incentives later
 *
 * STATE 1 is decided by `useAccount` so a visitor who has never connected does
 * not pay for any contract reads. STATES 2-4 all live in <JarDashboard />,
 * which is mounted once and switches internally - that keeps the hook order
 * stable across state transitions (no remount, no lost tx status).
